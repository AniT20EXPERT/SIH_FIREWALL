nodejs server with cpp exe interactions 

WFP APPLICATION exe constantly accesses info file which has all the WFP instructions.
this info file is stored somewhere in pc local. every 1 second my cpp application access our nodejs server (with db) and gets the schema info file with info as given by ui. 
And overwrites the old schema file in local pc with my new schema file.(only if changes are observed).



websockets c++ and nodejs
sha256 hashing algo
mongodb collections






1)setup node js server with mongodb 
	
	setup route to get file hash (sha256) from collections for the document
	setup route to get file content
2) cpp application that fetches every 5 mins the route to get file hash
	converts the local instruction file to hash (sha256)
	COMPARES THE old local file hash with the newly fetched file hash, if different then 	fetches for file content
	overwrite the local file with new file

	this file is json




************************
first start the server with no rules document in mongodb

UI makes updates and creates rule document which is posted to /addrule

my cpp application then fetches the rule body and saves it to instuction_file folder (from where WFP cpp application accesses it ) and calculates its hash, now every 5 seconds application fetches hash from server and compares the 2 hashes (local rule_file hash and latest rule_file hash on server).
whenever changes are observed then it fetches new rule_file body and overwrites the local rule_file and again computes hash.
this cycle keeps repeating


compare two json strings



1)start nodejs server
2)if mongo is not empty then first make a PUT operation with new rule
if mongo is empty then directly make a POST opertation with new rule
3) run cpp application, then observe changes
